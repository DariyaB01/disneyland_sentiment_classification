Had not been to a Disney before so not really sure what to expect, but I enjoyed it. Lines to rides not too bad in the morning but were really long for some things later in the day. Some brilliant rides   displays   its a small world was probably my favourite and the boat ride was fun. Tried most of the rides   they are not very long and you will spend longer waiting than the ride takes. Food was expensive, but this is typical of all theme parks. The grounds were lovely and there was a nice vibe in the place. I found many of the staff did not look terribly happy or smiley, which I would expect in a Disney environment, but perhaps they were just having a bad day. Overall, am glad I went and can say have been to Disneyland, although next time would like to try a bigger version.\",\n          \"visited Hong Kong Disneyland on the 14th May 2015, i used the MTR to get there which was a very quick and efficient way of travelling there from Hong Kong Island. I had already purchased my ticket from the hotel I was staying at which cost me $499 Hkd. Never having been to any of the Disneyland resorts I don't have much to compare it to, I found that the wait times for most of the rides weren't very long and as I was visiting by myself I was able to get on some of the rides a lot quicker as a single rider. Overall I had a good day there and if would definitely go again if i was travelling in the region. Based on some of the other reviews i have read about wait times and crowding, I didnt experience any of these issues.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"topic\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"gift shops\",\n          \"duration of visit\",\n          \"park size\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 2,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2,\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
